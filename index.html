    <h1>Contribute Demo</h1>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      This is a simple demo page for the Contribute community moderated comments platform.
      You should see a comments thread directly below. If you'd like to leave a comment, you can do so by signing up for an account
       <a href="https://contribute-app.herokuapp.com/sign_up">here</a>. You should then be able to log in below and leave a comment.
    </p>
    <p>
       Please note that due to the community moderation system, new users comments will be screened before posting, which means you
       will likely see a default approval pending message in place of your comment until it is approved by other commenters.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can't see the comments thread below, it's most likely because the app hasn't seen recent use and has gone to sleep (It's hosted on Heroku).
      I'd recommend hard refreshing the page after 20 seconds or so, and if you still can't see anything, clear your cache and try again.
      If after that you STILL can't see anything, please let me know!
